        "content": "Hmm, it seems the question prompts aren't going through. Let me write my questions directly:\n\nTwo quick clarifications before I scope this as an epic:\n\n1. **\"More text\"** — The title is currently truncated to 1 line. Would you prefer:\n   - **2-line title** — let the title wrap to 2 lines (via `line-clamp-2`) instead of 1-line truncation, or\n   - **Title + description snippet** — keep the title as-is and add a 1-2 line description preview below it?\n\n2. **ID placement** — Where should the ID appear on the card?\n   - **Bottom-left**, inline with the US count (e.g. `ABC123 · 2/5 US`), or\n   - **Top, before the title**, as a small muted prefix?\n\nThese are all small, self-contained changes to a single file (`components/kanban/EpicCard.tsx`), so this could be a tight 3-story epic — or even just 1 story with 3 acceptance criteria. Let me know your preferences and I'll write up the final epic spec.",

        "content": "Good — I have a clear picture. Here's my assessment:\n\n**This is well-scoped and straightforward.** All three changes target `components/kanban/EpicCard.tsx` and the data is already available (`epic.id`, `epic.description`, `selected` prop with ring highlight). No schema changes, no new API routes.\n\nI'd suggest writing this as a **single user story** with 3 acceptance criteria rather than a 3-story epic, since:\n- All changes are in one file\n- No backend work needed — `description` and `id` are already in `KanbanEpic`\n- They're all cosmetic tweaks, not independent features\n\nHere's the refined scope:\n\n**Epic title**: \"Epic Card UI Polish: Selection, Description Preview & ID Display\"\n\n**Single user story** — \"As a user viewing the kanban board, I want cleaner epic cards that show the ID, a description preview, and subtle selection highlighting without a checkbox.\"\n\n**Acceptance criteria**:\n1. **Remove checkbox** — Remove the `<Square>`/`<CheckSquare>` button; selection is indicated solely by the existing `ring-2 ring-primary` highlight (click-to-select still works via `onToggleSelect`)\n2. **Add description snippet** — Below the title, show 1-2 lines of `epic.description` in muted text with `line-clamp-2`, hidden if `null`\n3. **Show ID prefix** — Above the title, display `epic.id` as a small muted monospace label (e.g., `text-xs text-muted-foreground font-mono`)\n\nDoes that match your intent, or would you prefer any adjustments — for example, should clicking the card body still toggle selection, or only navigate to the epic detail?",

        "content": "Good — `KanbanEpic` has `description: string | null` and `id: string`. Everything needed is already in the type. This is a straightforward single-file change. Since the conversation agreed on a single user story, I'll honor that but the instructions say 2-8 user stories. I'll structure it as the agreed single story since the scope is very small — but actually the instruction says \"Generate 2-8 user stories\", so let me split into 2 minimal stories.\n\nGiven the explicit instruction format requirement (\"Return ONLY a JSON code block\"), here's the epic:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Epic Card UI Polish: Selection, Description Preview & ID Display\",\n  \"description\": \"Refine the EpicCard component on the kanban board to improve scannability and reduce visual clutter.

Remove checkbox, rely on ring highlight for selection\\n- Remove the `<Square>` / `<CheckSquare>` button block (lines 111-125)\\n- Remove unused `Square` and `CheckSquare` imports from lucide-react\\n- Selection remains indicated by the existing `ring-2 ring-primary` class on the Card\\n- `onToggleSelect` is still called via the card's `onClick` — add a click handler that calls `onToggleSelect` when the card body is clicked (or keep existing behavior if `onClick` already handles it)\\n\\n### 2. Show epic ID as a muted monospace prefix above the title\\n- Add a `<span>` with classes `text-xs text-muted-foreground font-mono` displaying `epic.id` above the title line\\n\\n### 3. Add 1-2 line description preview below the title\\n- Below the title `<h4>`, render `epic.description` in `text-xs text-muted-foreground line-clamp-2`\\n- Only render when `epic.description` is non-null and non-empty\\n\\n### File to modify\\n- `components/kanban/EpicCard.tsx`\",\n  \"userStories\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"As a user viewing the kanban board, I want epic cards to show the ID and a description preview so that I can identify and distinguish epics at a glance\",\n      \"description\": \"Add two new pieces of information to the EpicCard component:\\n1.
